function Get-CM7CollectionIncludeMembershipRule {
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
            Retrieves include membership rules for a MECM collection using CIM.

        .DESCRIPTION
            Queries the SMS_Collection WMI class to retrieve include collection membership rules
            for a MECM collection. Include rules reference another collection whose members are
            included in the parent collection's effective membership. Supports filtering by
            collection name, CollectionId, included collection name, or included collection ID.
            Requires an active connection established via Connect-CM7.

        .PARAMETER CollectionName
            Specifies the name of the collection to retrieve include membership rules for.

        .PARAMETER CollectionId
            Specifies the CollectionID of the collection to retrieve include membership rules for.

        .PARAMETER IncludeCollectionName
            Specifies the name of the included collection to filter rules by. Supports wildcard characters (*).

        .PARAMETER IncludeCollectionId
            Specifies the CollectionID of the included collection to filter rules by.

        .EXAMPLE
            Get-CM7CollectionIncludeMembershipRule -CollectionName "All Systems"
            Retrieves all include membership rules for the "All Systems" collection.

        .EXAMPLE
            Get-CM7CollectionIncludeMembershipRule -CollectionName "All Systems" -IncludeCollectionName "Test*"
            Retrieves include membership rules matching the pattern "Test*" from the "All Systems" collection.

        .EXAMPLE
            Get-CM7CollectionIncludeMembershipRule -CollectionId "SMS00001" -IncludeCollectionId "SMS00002"
            Retrieves the include membership rule for the specified included collection ID.

        .NOTES
            This function queries the SMS_Collection class and inspects its CollectionRules property
            for rules of type SMS_CollectionRuleIncludeCollection.
            For direct members, see Get-CM7CollectionDirectMembershipRule.
            For exclude rules, see Get-CM7CollectionExcludeMembershipRule.
